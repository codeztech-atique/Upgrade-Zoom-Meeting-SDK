## Overview

This project demonstrates how to upgrade the Zoom Meeting SDK for a web application built with JavaScript and JSP. The upgrade from version 2.18.2 to 3.1.6 includes optimizations, new features, and better security practices. It is designed to work within a servlet container like Apache Tomcat.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 17 or later.
- **Servlet Container**: Apache Tomcat or any other compatible servlet container.
- **Zoom Developer Account**: API Key and API Secret from the [Zoom Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/).
- **Xcode** (for macOS users): Ensure Xcode is installed and the license is accepted:
   ```bash
   sudo xcodebuild -license
   ```

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/codeztech-atique/Upgrade-Zoom-Meeting-SDK.git
cd Upgrade-Zoom-Meeting-SDK

2. Deploy the Application

Place the project files in your servlet containerâ€™s webapps directory (e.g., for Apache Tomcat: tomcat/webapps).
Start your servlet container (e.g., catalina.sh start for Tomcat).

3. Ensure Dependencies Are Met

Verify that all JSP files compile correctly, and Java dependencies are satisfied within the servlet container.

## Configuration

Configure the application with your Zoom SDK credentials:

js/index.js

```bash
var CLIENT_ID = "";
var CLIENT_SECRET = "";
```
